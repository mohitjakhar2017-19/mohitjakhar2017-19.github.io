                A mutual fund is a financial instrument which draws money from a plethora of investors. This common fund is created with mutual contribution of multiple investors in a variety of assets and securities including debts, equities, government securities, liquid assets like funds, bonds, and others. Since all the gains, rewards, risks, profits, and losses resulting from or pertaining to this type of fund is shared by all the contributors according to their investment proportion, it is named as a mutual fund.

</strong></p><p></p><div><em><strong>Equity Funds-</strong></em></div><div>These funds capitalise the money in the equity shares and stocks of various companies. Though this sort of investment involves high risk, the possibility of getting a huge return in such funds is more.
</div><div><strong><em>Debt Funds-</em></strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Debt funds invest in government bonds, company debentures, and other fixed income instruments with an objective of providing fixed returns to the investors. This is why these funds are considered to come with very low risk and fixed returns.</span></div><div><strong><em>Money market funds-</em></strong></div><div> In this type of fund, the money will be invested in liquid assets like CPs, T-Bills etc. These investments are considered to be safe and best for investors who want a quick and moderate return from their investment.
</div><div><strong><em>Balanced or Hybrid Funds-</em></strong> </div><div>These funds capitalise in a diverse range of high risk and low risk asset classes to balance the risk as well as the return. The proportion of equity is more than debt in certain cases while it is the opposite in others. By distributing your money among multiple securities, it creates a balance between the risk and the return.
</div><div><strong><em>Sector Funds-</em></strong> </div><div>Such funds make investment only in one specific sector. Sector funds like the infrastructure funds capitalise only in the companies and instruments that are related to the infrastructure sector. As a result, the returns from this type of funds are limited to the performance of that particular sector. However, the associated risk in such schemes is dependent on the nature of the chosen sector.
</div><div><strong><em>Index Funds-</em></strong> </div><div>The index funds are those funds that capitalise in assets to imitate the performance and the returns of any specific index. For example, purchasing the shares which represent the BSE Sensex.
</div><div><strong><em>Tax Saving Funds-</em></strong> </div><div>These funds mainly invest in equity shares and all the investments made in this type of fund are eligible for tax benefits under the Income Tax Act. Though these funds come with high associated risk, if the performance of the fund is good then the chances of getting high returns is high as well.
</div><div><strong><em>Fund of Funds-</em></strong> </div><div>These funds capitalise in other mutual funds and give good returns if the targeted fund does well in the stock market.</div><div><br></div><div><strong><em>Open-Ended funds:</em></strong></div><div>These funds are known as open-ended because these units can be purchased and redeemed at any given point of time. Investors prefer these type of funds because they can encash their unit in real money as per their wish and preferences.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div><strong><em>Close-Ended Funds:</em></strong> </div><div>These funds are called close-ended funds as these can be purchased only during the initial offer period. After that the units will be locked and can only be redeemed after a predetermined maturity date. These funds are often listed on the stock exchange to bring liquidity in the sector.</div><p></p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>Mutual Fund Advantages
</strong></p><p><strong><em>Professional management-</em></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Professional managers are the persons who manage and look after mutual funds in the asset management companies. Using their expertise and ability to manage risks, these managers not only reduce the risk of mutual fund investment but they also boost the returns for the investors. The investors receive great help from the managers to decide which type of asset classes they should invest in, which is otherwise very difficult for investors to understand as most of them have very little knowledge in fund investment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><em>Diversification of risks-</em></strong> </p><p>The risk in mutual fund investment is diversified by investing in a combination of assets and securities. When an investor invests in a wide variety of securities and assets, there is rarely any chance that all the assets will perform badly. While an investor has some loss on a particular asset, his/her loss gets compensated by the profits made from the other stocks. As a result of this diversification of assets, the risks get reduced to a great extent.
</p><p><strong><em>Reasonable investment alternative- </em></strong>Contributing in mutual funds is a very good investment option for people from low-income groups as well as for those who are not in a position to invest a large sum of money in one go in direct equity or other securities requiring high preliminary payment. Moreover, as the cost of transaction is divided among multiple investors, the individual cost is relatively low.
</p><p><strong><em>Well-organised investment-</em></strong> </p><p>As the mutual fund offer document clearly specifies the targeted investment assets, being an investor you clearly know in which assets your money is invested. This helps you to make contributions in a well-organised and focussed manner. Moreover, these types of funds give the investors access to some specific securities which are not otherwise available for direct investment. For example, foreign securities or sectors are barred for individuals.
</p><p><strong><em>Unlimited investment option-</em></strong> </p><p>The investors are provided with the opportunity of investing their money in a wide range of secured options like regional funds, index funds, equity funds, money market funds, debt funds, sector funds, fund of funds, etc. This wide variety of assets not only help you to diversify your portfolio but saves you from the risk of depending on any particular type of asset class.
</p><p><strong><em>Quick purchase and sale option-</em></strong> </p><p>If the investors are investing without any lock-in period, then they can sell the fund units anytime at the prevailing NAV or unit prices. This liquidity of mutual funds allows the investors to purchase and redeem their fund units whenever they want to.
</p><p><strong><em>Tax relief-</em></strong> </p><p>Paying tax is a huge burden and keeping this under consideration certain mutual fund schemes are specially designed to offer tax benefits to the investors. For example, investments made in the equity-linked saving schemes or ELSS are eligible for tax deduction benefits.
</p><p><strong><em>Best return-</em></strong> </p><p>Mutual fund schemes are specially designed to help the investors get maximum return on their investment. Investors can diversify their investment in medium to long-term plans and get the expected return keeping the risk factor within a manageable range.
</p><p><strong><em>Government regulated investment-</em></strong> Since SEBI (Securities Exchange Board of India) manages all the mutual funds and regulates their dealings, the investors can relax as their investment is under the purview of a government regulatory body.
</p><p><strong><em>Ease of tracking-</em></strong></p><p>It is not easy for the investors to track each and every investment portfolio individually. To make the process easier, a detailed and clear statement of the investments are provided to the investors so that they can keep track of their invested amount on a regular basis.
</p><p><strong><em>Small investment option-</em></strong> SIP (Systematic Investment Plans) allow the investors to contribute small sum at regular intervals. This is a very convenient option for people who cannot afford to do huge investments at one go. Due to the availability of this option, people from all income levels can invest in mutual funds at a minimum amount of Rs.500.
</p><p><strong><em>Fund switching facility-</em></strong> There are various funds which offer investors the flexibility of switching between funds or schemes for availing better schemes as well as better returns. This facility enables the investors to shift their investment wholly or partially whenever they want in order to avail the maximum output.<br></p><div><br></div><p></p></div>
